Changes since 1.3.0

* Fixed duplicate/missing breakpoints (bug #5965).

* Fixed swapped flags in TOC parsing code (bug #4831).

* Fixed option handling code (bug #4180).

Changes since 1.2

* Build system has been rewritten using automake/autoconf.

* Added append, prepend, and split pregap modes to cuebreakpoints.

* Fixed possible compilation error with Bison.

* All tools accept long options.

* Programs exit if --input-format or --output-format is an illegal value.

Changes since 1.1

* cuebreakpoints was not printing the last track breakpoint.  This has been
  fixed.

* cueprint now prints a zero-length string for undefined values.  Flags, width,
  and precision are applied to conversion characters which have no conversion.

* Added a tagging script, cuetag.sh, which uses cueprint, vorbiscomment, and
  mp3info to tag Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files.  This needs more testing and
  documentation.

* Added a track selection flag to cueprint.

Changes since 1.0

* File formats documentation has been readded and updated (docs/formats.txt).

* ``CDTEXTFILE`` is now a recognized (but ignored) keyword.

* If only a disc or track template is specified on the command line, then only
  the disc or track information is printed, respectively.

* cueprint now supports flags and width and precision values for template
  expansion (like the printf command).

Changes since 0.6

* cuetools-1.x is a significant code rewrite of 0.x.  The cue/toc parsing code
  has been reimplemented in lex/yacc.

* cuerename has been replaced by the more general utility cueprint.

* Usage syntax of the utilities has changed.  See the respective man pages.
